# Project in Computer Science: DeepCode phase 1: Compilers approach

This project tries to filled optimise AI processing of source code data-sets. This repository provides a tool able to generate custom AST given a generic Python code. Furthermore, extensions such extracting a report of the quality of the custom AST or evaluation or a full data-set can be found in the application.

## Getting Started
Clone repository at tag FinalA by doing:
```
git clone --branch FinalA https://miquelpuigmena@bitbucket.org/edan70/2019-deepcode-miquel.git
```
It is recommended to create a virtualenv specifically for this project.


### Prerequisites
Python3.6
pip3 packages:
```
- argparse
- pickle
- ast2json
- json
- re
- modulefinder
- matplotlib
- logging
```

## Running the program
Firstly locate system in folder
```
cd path/to/folder
```
Usage options are 
```
python3 run.py [-h] [-D DATASET] [-f FILE] [-m {exec,eval,single}] [-O{json,pickle}] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-v] [--with-report]
```
Examples of usage can be found by typing
```
python3 run.py -h/--help
```

## Running the tests
Locate system in project folder
```
cd path/to/folder
```
To run unittests defined in tests/test.py
```
python3 -m unittests tests/test.py
```
Following cases are tested when running unittests:
```
- Check cAST when feeding empty file to the tool
- Check cAST when feeding general test file
- Check compression rate improves AST generated by Python's engine
```
